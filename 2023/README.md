# 2023

### plans for the future AOCs
 - maybe have a small library of useful functions (probably not as much as some other people)
 - store the parts in two files and have a common one.
 - either by macro or copy paste, generate a test for part 1 and part two, generate the command line day decider, and allow for easily setting the test case answer..
 - I am also going to try to get better at making small, fast solutions. By looking at the real input I can compare what scales from the test case and only sometimes write dynamic parsing.
